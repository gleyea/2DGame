# 2DGame
This game was created for one of my courses at Télécom SudParis option JIN (Video Games and Digital Interactions).
The goal of this game was to create a 2D platformer without any graphics but with good collisions/movements.
This was done within 2 weeks. The game is also playable with a xbox controller.

Controls : 
-Arrows to move (left stick with a controller)
-Space to jump (A button with a controller)
